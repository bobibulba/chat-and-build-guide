					<h3>Describe Your Project</h3>
					<p>In the chat interface, describe what you want to build. Be as specific as possible about the features and functionality. Here's an example:</p>
					<div class="example-prompt">
						<p>"I want to build a personal portfolio website with sections for my bio, skills, projects, and contact information. I'd like a modern, minimalist design with a dark theme. The projects section should display cards with images and descriptions of my work."</p>

		<h2>Step 2: Refining Your Project Through Conversation</h2>
		<div class="step-container">
			<div class="step">
				<div class="step-number">1</div>
				<div class="step-content">
					<h3>Answer Clarifying Questions</h3>
					<p>ChatAndBuild will ask you questions to better understand your needs. Answer these questions to help refine your project requirements.</p>
					<div class="example-conversation">
						<div class="ai-message">
							<strong>ChatAndBuild:</strong> "Would you like your portfolio to be a single-page application where users scroll through sections, or would you prefer separate pages for each section?"
						</div>
						<div class="user-message">
							<strong>You:</strong> "I'd prefer a single-page application with smooth scrolling between sections."
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="step">
				<div class="step-number">2</div>
				<div class="step-content">
					<h3>Provide Additional Details</h3>
					<p>As the conversation progresses, provide more specific details about your preferences, such as colors, layouts, and functionality.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="user-message">
							<strong>You:</strong> "I'd like dark blue (#1a1a2e) as the background with teal (#0f3460) accents. For fonts, I prefer Poppins for headings and Open Sans for body text."
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="step">
				<div class="step-number">3</div>
				<div class="step-content">

		<h2>Tips for Effective Communication with ChatAndBuild</h2>
		<div class="tips-grid">
			<div class="card">
				<h3>Be Specific</h3>
				<p>The more specific you are about what you want, the better ChatAndBuild can help you. Instead of saying "I want a nice button," say "I want a rounded blue button with white text that says 'Submit' and has a subtle shadow effect."</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="card">
				<h3>Use Visual References</h3>
				<p>If you have examples of designs or features you like, describe them in detail or mention websites that have similar elements.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="card">
				<h3>Ask Questions</h3>
				<p>If you don't understand something or want to learn more about how a feature works, just ask! ChatAndBuild can explain concepts and provide educational information.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="card">
				<h3>Be Patient</h3>
				<p>Building software takes time, even with AI assistance. Complex features might require multiple iterations to get right.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="warning">
			<strong>Important:</strong> Always save your work! While ChatAndBuild automatically saves your project, it's a good practice to download your project files periodically as a backup.
